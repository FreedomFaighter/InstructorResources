### Grading Guidelines

**Merge Student Pull Request:**  
You will receive a pull request from each student.
Merge that pull request and leave them a note saying that files have been merged and that you will let them know if any updates or modifications need to be made

**Evaluate Assinments:**   
Go to QBstudent organization: https://github.com/QBstudents
For each student (e.g., QB2017_Gibson)do the following:

1) Go to pull requests tab (e.g., https://github.com/QBstudents/QB2017_Gibson/pulls)

2) Click on "closed" line to access a list of merged pull requests. 
Choose Assignment you are looking to grade (e.g., commit message: finished temporal assignment")

3) Click on "Files Changed" tab. Look for Assignment you are looking to grade (e.g.,  Week5-Temporal/temporal_assignment.html). Click on the "Load diff" link.
Here, you will be able to scan through and see added material (green) and deleted material (red).
If you scroll over code sections, a blue plus symbol will appear. 
Click on this blue symbol to add a comment (i.e., feedback).
Flag student (e.g., @gibsonMatt) and then type comment. Click "Add single comment".

4) As an alternative, you can go directly to a student's Assignment file and add feedback as an Issue (e.g., https://github.com/QBstudents/QB2017_Gibson/tree/master/Week5-Temporal).
Along the top, click on the "Issues" tab and then clikc on "New Issue".
Add a title and leave a comment (using for example, e.g., @gibsonMatt) and then click "Submit new issue".


5) Starting from previous bullet under "Files changed", you may also want to open/view a pdf of the Assignment (e.g., Week5-Temporal/temporal_assignment.pdf). 
Onec located, click the "view" tab on the right sign of the line. 

**Recommended Feedback:**   
 1) For each student record in Excel sheet in QB Box folder whether the Assignment was turned in on time and whether or not it was complete.
 These are the minimum criteria. 
 
 2) It's likely that certain questions will require more respones than others.
 You may want to open a separate text file that contains a well thought-out explanation.
 You can "resuse" the response. 
 At a minimum, supply three comments per Assignment.
